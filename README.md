This is a very simple "rhythm" game that uses the keyboard LEDs as only display
method.

One of the three keyboard LEDs light up to indicate an incoming "note" and the user must press the key directly below
it to "hit the note". For example, the CAPSLOCK key lights up and the user
presses `*` on the numpad.

This is just an experiment on using unexpected display methods. It assumes a
keyboard like this ![Expected keyboard layout](http://cdn.instructables.com/F6Y/XWAF/FOVWMANA/F6YXWAFFOVWMANA.LARGE.jpg)

It works on Linux only (tested on Ubuntu) and your LEDs may or may not go back
to normal. In they don't, just press the key that turns them on and off again.
